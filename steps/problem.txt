Hopping Jack is standing at the bottom of a long flight of stairs. The bottom of the stairs has number 0 , first step has number 1, the next step has number 2, and so on upto infinity

Jack will now perform  N consecutive actions. The actions are numbered 1 through N, in that particular order. When performing action , Jack chooses between two options:
- either he does nothing
- or he hops exactly X steps up the stairs.
In other words, if Jack starts performing action X standing on step Y , he will end it either on step Y , or on step Y + X.

For example, if N=3 , Jack will make three consecutive choices: whether or not to hop 1 step upwards, 2 steps upwards, and then 3 steps upwards.

One of the steps is broken. The number of this step is K. Jack cannot hop onto this step. 
You are given the integers N and K. Compute and print the number of the topmost step that can be reached by Jack provided that Jack starts from the bottom of the stairs at step 0?
